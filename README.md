# HeyDay

## What is HeyDay?
Hey Day is a time-honored tradition that has its roots dating all the way back to 1947 at Auburn University. It was born out of a need to address the feelings of isolation and invisibility experienced by students who had returned from serving in World War II. In response, Auburn University's student body and members of the Student Government Association came together to create a special day known as Hey Day. This event, held annually, is designed to unite the Auburn Family and foster a warm and welcoming atmosphere. During Hey Day, every student has the opportunity to wear a name tag, a simple yet powerful gesture that helps everyone on campus feel a sense of belonging. This tradition has endured over the years and has become one of Auburn University's most cherished and longest-standing traditions. It's a day that the student body eagerly anticipates each year, and it continues to bring all members of the Auburn community closer together.
